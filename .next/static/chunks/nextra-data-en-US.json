(2022), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding.Prompt:\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.\nA: Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25.

The answer is False.\nWow! We can see a perfect result when we provided the reasoning step. In fact, we can solve this task by providing even fewer examples, i.e., just one example seems enough:Prompt:\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.\nA: Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25.

The answer is False.\nKeep in mind that the authors claim that this is an emergent ability that arises with sufficiently large language models.","zero-shot-cot-prompting#Zero-shot COT Prompting":"Image Source: Kojima et al. (2022)One recent idea that came out more recently is the idea of zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al. 2022) that essentially involves adding \"Let's think step by step\" to the original prompt. Let's try a simple problem and see how the model performs:Prompt:\nI went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?\nOutput:\n11 apples\nThe answer is incorrect! Now Let's try with the special prompt.Prompt:\nI went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?\n\nLet's think step by step.\nOutput:\nFirst, you started with 10 apples.\nYou gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left.\nThen you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples.\nFinally, you ate 1 apple, so you would remain with 10 apples.\nIt's impressive that this simple prompt is effective at this task. This is particularly useful where you don't have too many examples to use in the prompt.","automatic-chain-of-thought-auto-cot#Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT)":"When applying chain-of-thought prompting with demonstrations, the process involves hand-crafting effective and diverse examples. This manual effort could lead to suboptimal solutions. Zhang et al. (2022) propose an approach to eliminate manual efforts by leveraging LLMs with \"Let's think step by step\" prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one. This automatic process can still end up with mistakes in generated chains. To mitigate the effects of the mistakes, the diversity of demonstrations matter. This work proposes Auto-CoT, which samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct the demonstrations.Auto-CoT consists of two main stages:\nStage 1): question clustering: partition questions of a given dataset into a few clusters\nStage 2): demonstration sampling: select a representative question from each cluster and generate its reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with simple heuristics\n\nThe simple heuristics could be length of questions (e.g., 60 tokens) and number of steps in rationale (e.g., 5 reasoning steps). This encourages the model to use simple and accurate demonstrations.The process is illustrated below:\n\nImage Source: Zhang et al. (2022)Code for Auto-CoT is available here."}},"/techniques/consistency":{"title":"Self-Consistency","data":{"":"Perhaps one of the more advanced techniques out there for prompt engineering is self-consistency. Proposed by Wang et al. (2022), self-consistency aims \"to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting\". The idea is to sample multiple, diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT, and use the generations to select the most consistent answer. This helps to boost the performance of CoT prompting on tasks involving arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.Let's try the following example for arithmetic reasoning:Prompt:\nWhen I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now\nI’m 70 how old is my sister?\nOutput:\n35\nThe output is wrong! How may we improve this with self-consistency? Let's try it out. We will use the few-shot exemplars from Wang et al. 2022 (Table 17):Prompt:\nQ: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done,\nthere will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\nA: We start with 15 trees. Later we have 21 trees. The difference must be the number of trees they planted.\nSo, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees. The answer is 6.\n\nQ: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\nA: There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.\n\nQ: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\nA: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74\nchocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.\n\nQ: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops\ndid Jason give to Denny?\nA: Jason had 20 lollipops. Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny. The number of\nlollipops he has given to Denny must have been 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does\nhe have now?\nA: He has 5 toys. He got 2 from mom, so after that he has 5 + 2 = 7 toys. Then he got 2 more from dad, so\nin total he has 7 + 2 = 9 toys. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from\nmonday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?\nA: There are 4 days from monday to thursday. 5 computers were added each day. That means in total 4 * 5 =\n20 computers were added. There were 9 computers in the beginning, so now there are 9 + 20 = 29 computers.\nThe answer is 29.\n\nQ: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many\ngolf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?\nA: Michael initially had 58 balls. He lost 23 on Tuesday, so after that he has 58 - 23 = 35 balls. On\nWednesday he lost 2 more so now he has 35 - 2 = 33 balls. The answer is 33.\n\nQ: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?\nA: She bought 5 bagels for $3 each. This means she spent $15. She has $8 left.\n\nQ: When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I’m 70 how old is my sister?\nA:\nOutput 1:\nWhen I was 6 my sister was half my age, so she was 3. Now I am 70, so she is 70 - 3 = 67. The answer is 67.\nOutput 2:\nWhen the narrator was 6, his sister was half his age, which is 3. Now that the narrator is 70, his sister would be 70 - 3 = 67 years old. The answer is 67.\nOutput 3:\nWhen I was 6 my sister was half my age, so she was 3. Now I am 70, so she is 70/2 = 35. The answer is 35.\nComputing for the final answer involves a few steps (check out the paper for the details) but for the sake of simplicity, we can see that there is already a majority answer emerging so that would essentially become the final answer."}}}

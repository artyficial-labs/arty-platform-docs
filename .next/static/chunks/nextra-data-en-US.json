It serves as a starting point for a conversation, writing piece, design project, or any other creative endeavor. Prompts are often used in education to stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.Additionally, prompts can be found in various forms, such as written instructions, visual images, or audio cues, depending on the context and purpose of the activity. Overall, prompts are powerful tools that can spark imagination, encourage reflection, and prompt action.","prompt-engineering#Prompt Engineering":"Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.Prompt engineering is not just about designing and developing prompts. It encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques that are useful for interacting and developing with LLMs. It's an important skill to interface, build with, and understand capabilities of LLMs. You can use prompt engineering to improve safety of LLMs and build new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external tools.Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, advanced prompting techniques, learning guides, model-specific prompting guides, lectures, references, new LLM capabilities, and tools related to prompt engineering.Topics:\nText Generation\nImage Generation"}}}

{"/papers/visual-analysis":{"title":"Brand > Logo: Visual Analysis of Fashion Brands","data":{"":"23 Oct 2018  Â·  M. Hadi Kiapour, Robinson PiramuthuWhile lots of people may think branding begins and ends with a logo, fashion brands communicate their uniqueness through a wide range of visual cues such as color, patterns and shapes. In this work, we analyze learned visual representations by deep networks that are trained to recognize fashion brands. In particular, the activation strength and extent of neurons are studied to provide interesting insights about visual brand expressions. The proposed method identifies where a brand stands in the spectrum of branding strategy, i.e., from trademark-emblazoned goods with bold logos to implicit no logo marketing.By quantifying attention maps, we are able to interpret the visual characteristics of a brand present in a single image and model the general design direction of a brand as a whole. We further investigate versatility of neurons and discover \"specialists\" that are highly brand-specific and \"generalists\" that detect diverse visual features. A human experiment based on three main visual scenarios of fashion brands is conducted to verify the alignment of our quantitative measures with the human perception of brands. This paper demonstrate how deep networks go beyond logos in order to recognize clothing brands in an image.","pdf#PDF":"Here is the Paper","view-on-arxiv#View on arXiv":"Here is the Abstract","code#Code":"Here is the Code","category#Category":"Marketing"}},"/papers/storytelling":{"title":"Generative AI-Driven Storytelling: A New Era for Marketing","data":{"":"Published on Sep 16, 2023Authors: Marko Vidrih , Shiva MayahiThis paper delves into the transformative power of Generative AI-driven storytelling in the realm of marketing. Generative AI, distinct from traditional machine learning, offers the capability to craft narratives that resonate with consumers on a deeply personal level. Through real-world examples from industry leaders like Google, Netflix and Stitch Fix, we elucidate how this technology shapes marketing strategies, personalizes consumer experiences, and navigates the challenges it presents.The paper also explores future directions and recommendations for generative AI-driven storytelling, including prospective applications such as real-time personalized storytelling, immersive storytelling experiences, and social media storytelling. By shedding light on the potential and impact of generative AI-driven storytelling in marketing, this paper contributes to the understanding of this cutting-edge approach and its transformative power in the field of marketing.","pdf#PDF":"Here is the Paper","view-on-arxiv#View on arXiv":"Here is the Abstract","code#Code":"No code provided","category#Category":"Storytelling"}}}

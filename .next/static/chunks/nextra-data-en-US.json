It serves as a starting point for a conversation, writing piece, design project, or any other creative endeavor. Prompts are often used in education to stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.Additionally, prompts can be found in various forms, such as written instructions, visual images, or audio cues, depending on the context and purpose of the activity. Overall, prompts are powerful tools that can spark imagination, encourage reflection, and prompt action.","prompt-engineering#Prompt Engineering":"Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.Prompt engineering is not just about designing and developing prompts. It encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques that are useful for interacting and developing with LLMs. It's an important skill to interface, build with, and understand capabilities of LLMs. You can use prompt engineering to improve safety of LLMs and build new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external tools.Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, advanced prompting techniques, learning guides, model-specific prompting guides, lectures, references, new LLM capabilities, and tools related to prompt engineering.Topics:\nText Generation\nImage Generation"}}}

### AI nodes

We have 5 model nodes that can be imported to your canvas. These are main nodes that tipically perform a cognitive function in workflows and have supporting nodes in the "Utility Nodes" submenu.

### Utility nodes

The last button on the sidebar opens up a submenu that has utility nodes under it. You can find all nodes that connect to their respective main AI node here.

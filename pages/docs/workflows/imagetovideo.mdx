### Prompt optimisation 

You can enable this function if you need the best out of your prompts. 

### Image Preview Node

Displays images from the Image Generator Node or other sources. Handles various aspect ratios and provides download functionality. Designed to visualize the output of image generation processes.

### Video Generation Node

You will need a video generation node to be able to generate videos. You can either use a first frame to generate your video or you can use a subject reference image to generate images. 

### Video Preview Node

You will also need a video preview node to be able to view your generated videos. Video generation takes a little longer to generate then image generation nodes so hang tight.

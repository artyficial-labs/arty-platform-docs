### Github Repo Node

Connects to GitHub repositories through a personal access token. Allows browsing repos, branches, and files, with optional RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) indexing for code-aware AI interactions. Serves as a code source for other nodes.

### Code Assistance Node

A powerful code-focused node that can generate, enhance, explain, or refactor code. Integrates with GitHub repositories for context, supports various programming languages, and enables interactive code exploration and modification.

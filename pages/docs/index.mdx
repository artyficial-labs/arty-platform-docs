## What is Artyficial Labs?

A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** AI Native Creative Engine to empower creative professionals with creative AI tools for building immersive worlds. 
The platform is a creative research effort to show how AI models and tools are impacting the creative process and immersive world building. This is achieved through an node-based infinite canvas that allows users to build workflows that aid them in conceptualising, designing and developing.

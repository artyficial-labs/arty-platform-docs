## 3D Generation Node - Alpha Stage

The 3D generation node is useful for creating basic 3D models from your images. Making it easy to prototype your character design ideas. In future you will be able to import these models into an animation node or game engine for a complete development process.

## 3D Generation Roles

- Generate 3D models
- Rigging
- General model previewing

## 3D Node Settings

You have a variety of settings that can help you optimise the quality of your generated model.

# List of settings:

Basic:

- Texture Size (Pixels) - Detailed texture texture generation(higher values take linger)
- Mesh Simplification - 
- Color Generation- Model geometry

Advanced:

- Seed
- Surface Sampling
- Surface Guidance
- SLAT Sampling Steps
- SLAT Guidence

## Connectors

- Image Preveiw Node
- Game Engine Node

## Input port

- Connect an image preveiw node to import an image for 3D modelling. You can connect up to 3 image preveiw nodes for an optimised render.

## Output port (Currently not working)

- In future you should be able to export your generated models into our game engine and use it for game play.

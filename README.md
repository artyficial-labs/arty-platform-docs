# Artyficial Research

Prompt engineering for Large Language and Diffusion Models are a relatively new disciplines for developing and optimizing creativity and life tasks in general. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language and diffusion models. Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of large language and diffusion models on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and creative research. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools. Creatives use prompt engineering for rapid creative brainstorming on projects like character development to storyboarding.

Motivated by the high interest in developing with Generative AI, we have compiled this artyficial research and prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, learning guides, lectures, references, and tools related to prompt engineering using Artyficial Labs generative AI tools.
